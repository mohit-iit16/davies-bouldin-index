# davies-bouldin-index
Daviesâ€“Bouldin index (DBI) (introduced by David L. Davies and Donald W. Bouldin in 1979) is a metric for evaluating clustering algorithms.[1] This is an internal evaluation scheme, where the validation of how well the clustering has been done is made using quantities and features inherent to the dataset.
